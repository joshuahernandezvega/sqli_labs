SQL INJECTION - LABS

Some exploitable scenarios include:

1. Login bypass
2. SQL injection using INSERT statements
3. 1=1 conditions could be critical
4. Blind SQL injection based on time and math
5. LFI (Local File Inclusion) exploitation
6. Practice of common bypass techniques for restricted words or characters
7. Bonus: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

Enjoy!
